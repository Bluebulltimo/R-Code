# R-Programming-Code-Examples

This is a collection of R programming code examples drawn from all kinds of sources.  I find them interesting examples which are also useful for study and learning how others write their codes.  I am storing them on GitHub for my own personal use, but others should feel free to use them, as well.  Whenever possible, I provide the source where I found the code.
